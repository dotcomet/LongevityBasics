    This is not therapy. This is a collection of ideas and new scientific research. I am not a doctor - please question everything you hear in this app.

  <p class="mainpage">
    Science is the best framework we have, in order to distinguish between hypothesis, theory and fact. Everything that is included in this app is scientific, which means that it needs to show a theory for a mechanism, supported by sufficient, statistically relevant data, which has been collected according to the scientific method. All findings go through a peer review process and constitute 'state of the art' scientific knowledge.
