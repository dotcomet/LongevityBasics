    The first person to live for 500 years is probably already alive.
    <br>Strangely enough this is the most knowledgeable and likely prediction of the future. Why? Gene sequencing, CRISPR, stem cells, nanotechnology, big data, etc. will fundamentally change ... everything. In the near future and exponentially fast.
    <br>Many different inventions will contribute to take us into the 'longevity escape velocity' - when every year yields progress that increases the average lifespan by more than one year.
