    Nutrition is big! If we avoid the systemic mistakes of the past, our outlook on aging will be very different. Many of the so-called 'diseases of aging' are the result of an unnatural diet. It will be interesting to see the influence of optimal nutrition on our functional lifespan.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Important concepts are
    <ul>
      <li>
          a low carb paleo diet, which includes only natural, nutrient dense, organic whole foods
      </li>
      <li>
          the avoidance of high blood sugar and a new appreciation of healthy fats - all the way to a ketogenic diet, which consists mostly of fat
      </li>
      <li>
          fasting as an important metabolic state
      </li>
      <li>
          a differentiated look at animal products
      </li>
      <li>
          'new food friends' to implement optimal nutrition
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    ... and a few thoughts on 'why it's not the end of the world if we eat unhealthy every once in a while'.

      <p>
      The paleo diet in 10 minutes:<br>
      Eat only the things that your body was built to eat. Many foods that humanity introduced into the diet, when we settled down a few thousand years ago, are probably harmful, especially when consumed regularly / in large quantities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our digestive system was built to handle the diet of a hunter gatherer: low toxic, nutrient-dense, organic whole foods, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>vegetables, roots</li>
          <li>seeds, nuts</li>
          <li>eggs, seafood, (organ) meat</li>
          <li>fruit (in moderation)</li>
          <li>preferably raw or steamed / prepared with low heat</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our metabolism was NOT built for:
        <ul>
          <li>an ongoing high carb load with regular blood sugar spikes</li>
          <li>large amounts of grains, legumes, dairy</li>
          <li>processed and unnatural foods</li>
          <li>the toxic load of industrial farming</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The influence of diet on healthspan is probably very high.

    <p>
      There are three macronutrients that can provide energy:
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Carbohydrates</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>with a normal western diet it is common that 70% of the calories come from carbohydrates. This is too much, over time ongoing spikes in blood sugar are damaging (inflammation, insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome). Carb intake should be below 30% (fructose: &lt; 5%)</li>
      <li>no (or very little) fast metabolizing carbs, such as flour (bread, pasta), sugar, rice, starches (potatoes) - except sometimes after a workout</li>
      <li>sugar is addictive</li>
      <li>the body can not access fat while it is in 'carb burning mode'</li>
      <li>glucose/fructose form AGEs, which damage the blood vessels</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Protein: </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>the most saturating macronutrient</li>
      <li>15-30% of the daily caloric intake should come from protein - increasing with age to maintain muscle mass.</li>
      <li>1 to 1,5 g of protein per 1 kg lean body mass (= weight minus body fat)</li>
      <li>sources of a protein in a paleo diet: meat, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, such as hemp and chia, whey</li>
      <li>plant protein less efficient regarding DPA/EPA</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Fat:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>healthy fats are the better fuel, over 50% of our caloric intake should come from fat. It's 'cleaner' energy, doesn't cause insulin spikes and in the long run protects the nervous system and the body from many diseases of aging</li>
      <li>the mainstream theory that dietary cholesterol, blood cholesterol and heart disease are linked is not correct. High cholesterol is the result of chronic high carb intake</li>
      <li>A high fat diet is NOT advisable for carriers of the APOE 4 mutation</li>
      <li>
        healthy fats, which can be consumed freely, are:
        <ul>
          <li class="secondli firstsecondli">saturated fats (meat, butter)</li>
          <li class="secondli">MCTs - which serve directly as fuel in the brain</li>
          <li class="secondli">monounsaturated fat (beef, olive oil, avocados, macadamia, etc)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        polyunsaturated fats are healthy in moderation
        <ul>
          <li class="secondli firstsecondli">should be less than 4% of caloric intake</li>
          <li class="secondli">omega-6 / omega-3 should be balanced to avoid inflammatory diseases</li>
          <li class="secondli">omega-6: eggs, meat, (toxic) high omega-6 vegetable oils, Brasil nuts</li>
          <li class="secondli">omega-3: seafood<br>flax, chia, hemp, walnuts are sources of omega-3 ALA, which needs to be converted into EPA and DHA, which is not efficient</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        unhealthy fats:
        <ul>
          <li class="secondli firstsecondli">high omega-6 vegetable oils (grape seed, corn, sunflower, etc.)</li>
          <li  class="secondli">trans fats (non dairy creamer, margarine, frosting, snacks and fried processed foods)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        foods on a paleo diet which are high in fat: avocado, coconut, nuts, fish, meat and butter/ghee (unlike other dairy products they don't contain lactose)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Plant based foods in general use much less resources and are cleaner to produce.
      <br>Animal products (eggs, fish, (organ) meat) are among the most nutrient dense foods. Without them some micronutrients are hard to obtain: i.e. calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin B12, A, D. The omega-6 in eggs and meat should be balanced with omega-3 from seafood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eggs
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>contain all vitamins (except vitamin C), minerals, antioxidants and 8g of protein</li>
      <li>do not cause high blood cholesterol</li>
      <li>should be organic to avoid the toxic load of industrial farming</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Meat
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>processed meat and factory farmed meat should be avoided</li>
      <li>grass fed, organic meat, free from drugs and hormones is high in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, protein and healthy fats</li>
      <li>organ meats are the most nutritious meats</li>
      <li>the link between red meat and heart disease does not withstand a scientific fact check - dietary cholesterol and saturated fat are not linked to high blood cholesterol levels</li>
      <li>the direct link between red meat and various diseases of aging could not be shown - when part of a healthy, balanced paleo diet. Other health related factors, such as micronutrient intake, workout, and toxic load influence the outcome in various studies</li>
      <li>high temperature methods of preparing should be avoided to prevent the formation of carcinogens</li>
    </ul>

      Fish and Seafood
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>best (and pretty much only considerable) source of EPA and DHA</li>
      <li>should be used to balance omega-6 intake through other animal products and nuts</li>
      <li>large, predatory fish (shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tuna) should be avoided because of mercury contamination. Small fish (anchovies, sardines) are preferable</li>
      <li>harmful industrial fishing / fish-farming should be avoided</li>

      <p>
        It has not been conclusively shown that caloric restriction works for humans. Nevertheless is fasting - and especially protein fasting - important for healing and maintaining metabolic function.
        <br>Fasting results in
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>increased antioxidative protection and cellular repair</li>
        <li>epigenetic changes</li>
        <li>higher levels of growth hormones</li>
        <li>increased insulin sensitivity</li>
        <li>lower inflammation </li>
        <li>lower risk for heart disease</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Intermittent fasting as well as a ketogenic diet show similar positive effects.

          <p>
            A ketogenic diet ...
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>puts the body into a state where most of it's energy comes from ketone bodies in the blood - and not from blood sugar</li>
            <li>is high in fat, moderate in protein (15-25%) and low in carbs (&lt;5% / &lt;50g/day)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When no carbs are consumed the mitochondria run out of glycogen and the liver starts to produce ketones as an alternative source of energy, which can travel the blood brain barrier. It is plausible to think that ketones are the preferred source of energy for our nervous system - and trigger other beneficial metabolic processes.
            <br>It will take up to 3 days to go into full ketosis (1.5-4 millimolar), progress can be tracked with a ketostix urine test (less than 10 bucks).
            <br>When in fat 'burning mode', the body can easily access body fat for energy.

        <li>nuts and nut butter</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>avocado</li>
        <li>green smoothie with loads of green leafs, colorful vegetables, some fruit and a bit of fat/oil</li>
        <li>fat shake (coconut oil, mct, almond milk, whey protein, nuts, avocado)</li>

      <p>
        Nutrition has a big influence on the so called 'diseases of ageing' - which to a good part are the consequence of an unnatural diet with two many blood sugar spikes and insufficient micronutrient intake.
        <br>Luckily all benefits of clean eating apply as well, when we eat clean 'most' of the time. 9 cups of greens every day - as Dr. Terry Wahls suggests - and  sufficient amounts of good protein and fat will probably make you feel great. If you then eat suboptimal food every week or so you will probably still feel great.
        <br>Things become problematic when chronic - amount and frequency make the difference. This is also true for alcohol: alcohol every once in a while is also not a problem - especially when low carb. 'Slipping' is fine and probably not even unhealthy - every decision is a new opportunity.
