    In tech testing routines are standard procedure - to measure performance and ensure stability. Continuous monitoring of all relevant parameters is a given, which applies to the human body too. Technology advances quickly and new screening methods with higher accuracy are beeing developed.
    <br>The tests in this first section – which are labled “quantified self “– are easy to do, an do not require a medical doctor. All values should be stored in a spredsheet to watch it change over time, as most diseases are the result of a long lasting and progressing imbalance.
    All values that are not in the normal range have to be retested and counteracted with changes in lifestyle, nutrition and supplementation.

      Beeing under- or especially overweight is one of the major risk factors for many diseases of aging. Body mass index puts weight in relation to height and is more meaningful than weight.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>BMI = (weight kg) / (height m2)</li>
      <li>BMI &lt; 18.5: underweight</li>
      <li>BMI &gt; 25: overweight </li>
      <li>BMI &gt; 30 obese</li>
      <li>normal: 18.5 - 25</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Waist size is more accurate as indicator for risk for heart disease.
    <br>Men:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waist size > 37" (93cm): overweight</li>
      <li>Waist size > 40" (101 cm): obese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Women:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waist size > 31.5" (80cm): overweight</li>
      <li>Waist size > 34.6" (88 cm): obese</li>
    </ul>

      Especially at an older age maintaining lean muscle mass becomes challenging and the status of someones muscles is one of the most reliable indicators of health and mortality.It is mandatory to measure body fat and lean muscle mass every once in a while.

        A food allergy is an unusual reaction of the immune system, mistakenly targeting certain foods Symptoms: rash, difficulty breathing, runny nose - appear a few minutes or hours after the meal.
        <br>90% of all food allergies are caused by 8 foods (mostly proteins): milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat and other grains that contain gluten, fish and shellfish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blood and skin tests for food allergies are very sensitive – they will very likely show an existing allergy, but also often produce false positives, which can lead to unnecessary dietary restrictions. Specific foods should be testesd - when symptoms appear - by an allergist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skin test
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>extracts of an allergen are rubbed or scratched into the skin, a rash/itch indicates an allergy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        IgE-test
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>levels of different antibodies are measured: significantly elevated values for a certain food may indicate an allergic reaction </li>
        <li>false positives are too common (50 - 75%) to make a broadband test the basis for dietary restrictions</li>
        <li>sometimes the presence of an antibody doesn't cause symptoms, and in some cases high IgE levels are associated with decreasing symptoms</li>
        <li>if no antibodies are found an allergy to that specific food can be ruled out</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Oral food challenge
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eating increasing amounts of the suspected food. Since symptoms of an allergy can be pretty severe, this should only be done with professional help</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Food intolerances
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>non allergic and caused by the malfunctioning of an enzyme, which results in an decreased ability to digest or absorb certain foods</li>
        <li>symptoms similar to those of a food allergy, but in general less acute </li>
        <li>an elimination diet, in which the suspected foods are excluded for at least 30 days, is the only way to reliably detect intolerances </li>
        <li>intolerances often overlap and cause other intolerances to develop, which makes it difficult to find the root cause</li>
        <li>foods which are most likely to cause an intolerance are:
        <br>dairy, grains that contain gluten, yeast, alcohol and foods that contain histamine</li>
        <li>Food additives only account for 1% of food intolerances</li>

      Genetic testing another game changer, which changes our outlook on aging:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>2003: the first human genome was deciphered. It took 13 years and cost 3 billion $</li>
      <li>medicine increasingly becomes a big data task, where we see exponential growth</li>
      <li>not only can we now read and increasingly understand the genetic code, but even 'write and reprogram our software' (CRISPR)</li>
      <li>today: complete genome can be derived from a saliva sample - offered by a private company '23andMe'. This takes a few a days and costs 200 $ / 169€</li>
      <li>personal results are shown on the 23andme webpage (inheritied conditions, genetic risk factors (predispositions), drug responses, heritage information, traits)</li>
      <li>raw data (full genome) can be downloaded and analysed with third party online cervices</li>
      <li>in the US health and wellness related reports were banned by the FDA, but in the UK and canada they are still available. Since 2015 the reports are re-introduced one by one, this time with FDA approval</li>
      <li>23andme continuously updates the information available for every individual. Artificial intelligence and data mining increase the understanding of the genome </li>
      <li>epigenetics adds another layer of complexity between the genotype and phenotype</li>
    </ul>
