    <p>
      Screenings help to detect disease early and require the help of an experienced doctor. They are another game changer which dramatically improve our outlook on aging and help to increase functional life span. Most diseases are treatable when diagnosed early - like i.e. most cancers, heart disease, aneurysms, etc.
This is a list of all meaningful screening methods, including cost, coverage by health insurance and risk factors such as age. The majority are simple, noninvasive and not expensive / with very high cost-benefit ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that we can prevent disease by trying to diagnose it early, is far from fully integrated in mainstream medicine. For an individual the question is not 'how much does screening vs. treatment cost' and but: 'which screenings exist, are meaningful and within a certain financial budget.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The German statutory health insurance offers a free check for everybody over 35 every two years, only 17% actually take the opportunity. 50% of all German women do not take female screenings (free of charge) and 85% of all German men ignore cancer screenings, which are very useful and 100% covered by statutory health insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of amazing tools to understand if something goes wrong. We just need to change our mindset to actually use them and benefit from them. There really is no downside – it is true that testing isn't always accurate and false positives are common, but a positive test result is only an indicator for further investigation. No one has ever died from a false positive, people die from diseases, which usually take years to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can expect exponential growth: artificial intelligence, imaging- and big data technology will massively increase the quality and the accuracy of the diagnosis. Watson, IBM's AI supercomputer is better at identifying skin lesions than the best human oncologists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today patients still rely on the competence and accuracy of their doctor – it makes sense to research the best experts and compare prices, which vary immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information about cost in this list is not too specific, the intention is to show price ranges.

              <p>
                Heavy metals (mercury, arsenic, cadmium, lead, aluminum, etc.) are ubiquitous, hence it is important to limit exposure. Seafood is the number one source of mercury. Bigger predatory fish (shark, tuna, king mackerel, salmon, etc.) have higher levels, smaller fish like anchovies or sardines are preferable.
                <br>Other sources of contamination: Pollution, exhaust fumes, paints that contain lead and amalgam fillings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Natural chelation agents are substances that bind to metal ions and are capable of mobilizing heavy metals stored in body:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>garlic</li>
                <li>onions</li>
                <li>green tea </li>
                <li>cilantro </li>
                <li>citrus pectin
                <br>(best used in conjunction with chlorella, which increases intestinal absorbing)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                An unhealthy accumulation of heavy metals has many negative effects:
                <br>Autoimmune issues, allergies, fatigue, brain fog and other problems affecting the nervous system. Over time heavy metals lead to a higher mutation rate and increased DNA damage.

              <p>
                False positives are possible. Testing requires a trustworthy doctor and two samples: provoced and unprovoked. Positive results should be retested with a hair or blood test.
                <br>Before treatment liver and kidney function need to be checked. An accumulation of heavy metals could indicate impaired detox capacities, which results in more severe symptoms during chelation (supplementation protocol or a series of intravenous administrations).

                Chronic inflammation is a sign that the immune system is overworked. It is linked to high cholesterol, Alzheimer's disease, depression, neurological issues and cancer.

                Gums and teeth may be affected by bacterial, viral or fungal infections, drugs, physical irritation or systemic disorders.
                <br>Dental hygiene and daily flossing are mandatory, as well as inspections / cleanings by a dentist every six months.
                <br>Cost: ~300 $/€, including an X-ray and professional cleaning. Very likely to be covered by health insurance.

                Amalgam fillings contain ~50% mercury, which is continuously emitted as vapor and can accumulate in the body.
                <br>There is no benefit compared to less risky and toxic materials. Mercury toxicity is linked to a long list of adverse effects: autoimminue disease, allergies, neurological and psychological problems, etc.
                <br>Amalgam fillings should be removed, which will cost somewhere around 250 $/€ per tooth - usually not covered by health insurance.

                      This is recommended at least once a year for everybody over 40, of course it doesn't hurt to do it earlier. The cost will be somewhere between 100 and 1000 $/€.

                      A special form of ultra sound is the so called doppler ultrasonography which uses the doppler effect to asses if something is moving away or towards the probe and it's velocity. So this can be used to show how blood moves through the blood vessels, and if there are any problems, such as blood clots or narrowings, aneurisms of course, decreased blood flow in the legs, problems with the valves – which are in the heart or in the veins to prevent backflow.
                      <br>As well as the blood flow in general in veins and arteries, in the abdomen, the chest, neck, arms and legs. It's even possible to detect arterial plaque, for example in the neck which may decrease the bloodflow to the brain and lead to a stroke.
                      <br>When done by an experienced radiologist, this gives a very good overview of blood vessel health and minimizes the risk for hear disease, heart attack, trombosis and stroke.

                          Uncontrolled growth of skin cells is by far the most common cancer, and the most common cancer in young adoults, especially women.
                          <br>90% of all non-melanoma cases are associated with DNA damage through UV radiation.
                          <br>Melanoma is rare (&lt; 1% of all skin cancers), but still in the top 20 of the cancers with the most casualties (130.000 cases every year worldwide).
                          <br>The risk for melanoma doubles with every 5 sunburns. UV radiation is needed for sufficient vitamin D production, but unprotected light human skin can not handle more than 10-20 mins of direct midday sunlight. Darker types are able to withstand more, but in general even a tan increases the chances of DNA damage. UV radiation is definitely a carcinogen and a main driver for skin ageing.

                            A colonscopy is a screening of the inner lining of the large intestine. A flexible tube with a camera is inserted anally for visual inspection: inflammation, bleeding, polyps - which are a small growth in the inner lining of the gut. It is usually benign but may develop into colon cancer over the course a few years. If polyps are not allowed to grow colon cancer can not develop.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In combination with occult blood testing (more) the risk for development of colon cancer can be reduced by over 90%.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Colon cancer is among the most fatal cancers (#4 world wide). Second or third most prevalent cancer in females - depending on etnicity, third most prevalent for men.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            5 stages are used to describe cancer growth, with every stage treatment gets more severe and 5 year survival rate drops:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>~ 95% stage 0 (only in the inner lining of the gut)</li>
                            <li>~ 80% stage 1 (affects the muscle tissue of the colon)</li>
                            <li>~ 55% stage 2 (grown through the wall and into nearby structures)</li>
                            <li>~ 40% stage 3 (spreading to lymph nodes)</li>
                            <li>~ 10% stage 4 (affecting other organs, usually is the liver / lung)</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                            Age is the most significant risk factor for colon cancer – 90% who are diagnosed are oer 50.
                            <br>A colonoscopy every 5 years is advised for everyone above 50. It is beneficial to have on or two earlier screenings. It takes 30 minutes.

                              Gastroscopy is a screening of the upper gastro intestinal tract (gullet, stomach and duodenom). An endoscope with a camera is inserted orally. Usually done with pain relivers and sedation.

                              Heliobacter pylori accounts for 60% cases of stomach (gastric) cancer. Men are affected twice as often. Globally it is the 5th most common cancer and 3rd leading cause of death from cancer. A gastroscopy is not a normal preventive procedure, and most likely not covered by health insurance – unless there are symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, heartburn, persistent abdominal pain or even bleeding.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Stomach cancer is very treatable when discovered early, long before symptoms occur, a gastroscopy is the only method of detection. Today only less than 10% of all gastric cancers diagnosed today are stage 0 - 1, when 5 year survival rate is about 80%. 80% of all cases are detected at stage 4, when 5 year survival rate has dropped to 5%.

                              <li>~ 56% stage 2 (lymph nodes affected and tumor has grown into muscle tissue)</li>
                              <li>~ 40% stage 3 (grown through the wall of the stomach)</li>
                              <li>~ 5%  stage 4 (other organs affected) </li>

                              Treatment gets more complicated and severe at every stage. Stomach cancer varies greatly by country, it is most prevalent in korea, mongolia and japan. In germany it is the 6th most common cancer for men and the 8th most common for women. In the US stomach cancer is comperatively rare and ranks only 16.
                              <br>Only 5% of the stomach cancer cases affect individuals under 40. The average age of diagnose is 69 years in the US (while often detected way too late). A first screening at 50 is advisable – according to overall risk in the respective part of the world. Anyone who wants to optimize their chances should start at 35. The exam will take less than 30 minutes.

                              Both tests are better done with the help of an experienced doctor, preferably every two years. A stool profile is probably not covered by health insurence without excisting risk factors or symptoms (digestive-, autoimmune issues, fatigue, mood disorder, etc). Irregularities are first and foremost a hint where to look further and retest.

                                A coronary calcium scan uses computer tomography (X-rays) to create detailed images of the heart and the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with blood. It takes about 30 minutes. Calcification of the coronary arteries is called coronary heart disease. It should be prevented at all cost and detected as early as possible to counteract with changes in lifestyle, workout and nutrition, or surgical interventions.

                                Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and accounts for 2nd most cancer deaths.
                                <br>Age is the most important risk factor: almost 90% of the diagnosed cases affect women over 50. Before 50 a simple physical exam without the burdon of X-rays is recommended. 12% of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed in women younger than 50.
                                <br>At stage 0 and 1 (only affects the breast, smaller than 1") the 5 year survival rate is almost 100%.
                                <br>At stage 4 (lymph nodes and other organs affected) it drops to below 15%.

                                        <strong>Orthopaedic checkup</strong>
                                        <br>An orthopaedic checkup every year is meaningful for everyone and has a very high cost-benefit ratio. Issues can be corrected with muscle training / physiotherapy, which gets increasingly difficult with age. Imbalances progress to a point where irrevocable damage occurs due to wear and tear (joints, cartilages, intervertebral discs). Additionally rheumatic diseases, arthritis and osteo-arthritis can be diagnosed.
                                        <br>The screening should include posture, muscular development and imbalances, mobility and constraints in movements, joints, feet, spine.

                                        Women are affected 4 times more often than men, especially after menopause. Age is the leading risk factor for ostheoporosis: at 50 about 2% of the women are affected, at 80 already 25%. Precausions to prevent bone fracture are necessary - hip fractures cause permanent mobility problems, 50% of patients are not able to live independently afterwards.
                                        <br>There is no cure for osteoporosis, but the progression can be slowed down with exercise, nutrition, hormone replacement therapy and medication.
                                        <br>It is advisable for women to start at 50 or with menopause, for men a dexa scan around this age is definitely interesting too (body fat and lean body mass are good indicators if nutrition and work out show the desired results. A good frequency is 2 years.

                                For those who want to max out the chances of early detection.
                                <br>'Magnetic resonance imaging' is a noninvasive, risk-less imaging technology, which only uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create a 3D- high resolution model of all structures in the body: Brain, spine with nerves and disks, blood vessels, aneurims, bleedings, tumors, bone marrow, bone infections, joint disorders, arthritis, gallstones, torn ligaments, problems of eyes or optic nerve.
                                <br>For some exams a contrast agent is necessary, which is given intravenously.

                              <p>
                                The test itself will usually take less than one hour, is completely pain free and should be repeated every 2-3 years.

                                <strong>Cost:</strong>
                                <br>750 - 1500 $/€ - prices vary greatly, it makes sense to research prices and competence.
