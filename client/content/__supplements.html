  <p>
    Some micronutrients are hard to obtain with a normal diet, some deficiencies are quite common. Soil depletion as a consequence of industrial farming increases the problem. This can be addressed with basic supplements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally there is good evidence, that an abundance of certain vitamins and minerals leads to an upregulation of declining metabolic processes, especially gene repair mechanisms. From a longevity point of view 'recommended daily allowances' (RDA) are not sufficient for the elderly, and many studies suggest that 'aggressive supplementation' can delay the onset of age related problems (longevity supplements).
  </p>
  <p>
    A few drugs have shown positive effects too - some have been prescribed to a lot of patients over a long period of time, which makes it reasonable to assume that they are safe (longevity drugs/pharmaceuticals).
  </p>
  <p>
    The best strategy to achieve perfect nutritional status is a diet of nutrient dense, whole foods - due to the complex interplay of the various minerals and vitamins.
    <br>Some types of food are much more nutrient dense than others (superfoods).

      There is good evidence that some micronutrients are desirable in higher doses than the RDA to support declining enzymatic functions with age and to counteract metabolic effects of genetic mutations. The RDA is not optimal for older individuals - aggressive supplementation probably delays the onset of age related diseases and is more likely to be beneficial than neutral or harmful.

            Superfoods contain a lot more of certain nutrients than other foods. Our metabolism requires various different nutrients to work in synergy, whole foods are the best strategy to achieve optimal nutritional values.
            <br>Included of course are the staple foods of a paleo diet: dark leafy greens, colorful vegetables, coconut oil, avocados, nuts and seeds, eggs, seafood, (organ) meat, fruit.
            <br>Other foods are specifically high in certain micronutrients - 'natural supplements'. The following selection is sort of a 'best of':
          </p>

            <li>huge amounts of antioxidants</li>
            <li>good evidence that it lowers the risk for certain cancers, heart disease, high cholesterol and insulin resistance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Raw cocoa
          </p>

            <li>powerful antioxidant - one of the highest scoring foods in this regard</li>
            <li>improves cholesterol levels, memory function and increases insulin sensitivity</li>
            <li>processing of cocoa removes many of the flavenols - raw cocoa nibs are best</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Ginkgo balboa
          </p>
          <ul>
