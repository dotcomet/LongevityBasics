    Training for perfect health takes 30 minutes every week.
    <br>Three principles are important:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>strength and frequency of the signal, which the body receives during the work out, determines the anabolic effect (building mode)</li>
    <li>recovery time after a sufficient signal is long - after a good training the body deals with adaption for at least a week. Another training during this recovery period is not necessary</li>
    <li>optimal training consists of the lowest necessary input to achieve the desired result </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Baseline training (weekly):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>20 minute high intensity strength training</li>
    <li>2 x 4 min tabata sprint training</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Additional (and optional): anything that is fun and trains balance, flexibility, mental clarity and range of motion. But only for fun and with sufficient attention to recovery from baseline training.
  <br>This applies to anyone. Actually the older a person is when she/he starts high intensity workouts, the bigger the positive effect - compared to baseline.
  <br>Try it for 3 months: Every week one super high intensity weight training, with a serious set of squats, and two uncompromising sprint sessions.
  <br>Rest of the time: fun and games, active recovery, meditation, relaxation, easy.
</p>

    <p>
      A high intensity strength training acts as an anabolic signal, which puts the body into 'building mode':
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>higher levels of growth hormones</li>
      <li>increased resting metabolic rate</li>
      <li>increased insulin sensitivity</li>
      <li>improved blood lipids</li>
      <li>lower blood pressure</li>
      <li>improved mood and cognitive function</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The recovery period, during which the metabolism reacts to the signal, is one week or above. During this time another anabolic signal is not overly effective - the body is in 'building mode' anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      A workout consists of weight training ...
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>with a lot of weight (5 reps in good form)</li>
  <li>with only one set for each muscle group</li>
  <li>for all muscle groups, starting with the big muscles (squats, deadlifts); then one push exercise; one pull exercise; and abs - to complete muscle failure</li>
  <li>for 20 minutes per week</li>
</ul>
<p>
  'Complete muscle failure' is key and determines the strength/intensity of the anabolic signal.
</p>
<p>
  Cardiovascular health and aerobic performance increase too, through:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>high intensity performance during the work out</li>
  <li>the metabolic processes during recovery</li>
  <li>the higher metabolic rate through increased muscle mass</li>
</ul>

      Short high-intensity sprint workouts (4 minutes, or even 1 min. sprints) increase anaerobic and aerobic function more than 45 minute mid-intensity 'cardio'-trainings.
      <br>A workout consist of 4 minutes of alternating high intensity performance and rest - either 30/30 secs or 20/10 secs, 8 repetitions in tabata.
      <br>Possible movements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>burpees</li>
      <li>cycle ergometer</li>
      <li>rowing</li>
      <li>swimming</li>

    <p>
      One high intensity strength training and two short sprint workouts are sufficient as baseline training. All other activities should be fun and train flexibility, balance, motor skills and a range of movements.
      <br>In any case they need to respect the body's recovery period from baseline training and serve as active relaxation.
